@article{SamudralaMoult:2931890,
    abstract = {
                The interconnected nature of interactions in protein structures appears to be the major hurdle in preventing the construction of accurate comparative models. We present an algorithm that uses graph theory to handle this problem. Each possible conformation of a residue in an amino acid sequence is represented using the notion of a node in a graph. Each node is given a weight based on the degree of the interaction between its side-chain atoms and the local main-chain atoms. Edges are then drawn between pairs of residue conformations/nodes that are consistent with each other (i.e. clash-free and satisfying geometrical constraints). The edges are weighted based on the interactions between the atoms of the two nodes. Once the entire graph is constructed, all the maximal sets of completely connected nodes (cliques) are found using a clique-finding algorithm. The cliques with the best weights represent the optimal combinations of the various main-chain and side-chain possibilities, taking the respective environments into account. The algorithm is used in a comparative modeling scenario to build side-chains, regions of main chain, and mix and match between different homologs in a context-sensitive manner. The predictive power of this method is assessed by applying it to cases where the experimental structure is not known in advance.

abstract ={A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},
