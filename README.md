Improving Recommender Systems by utilization of User Communities


This research includes the study of theory and methods needed to create a
Recommender System which exploits the information derived from a social
graph. Also we outline the design of a platform which locates User Communities
that will be used as a tool for achieving the above. The first part of the
research analyzes the basic concepts and approaches of Recommender Systems
in accordance with the relevant literature. Furthermore we make a study of
how such a system can be improved if combined with the field of social
networks. Next is the presentation of our own implementation of such a
system and finally we describe the integration of our program in an existing
personalization system to extend function and improve the accuracy of its
results.
